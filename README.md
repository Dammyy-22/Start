# My Project
# 1. The Core Theory (The What)
The CIA Triad: The goal of security is to maintain Confidentiality (privacy), Integrity (data accuracy), and Availability (uptime).

The AAA Framework: Security systems work by Authenticating users (checking ID), Authorizing them (giving permission), and Accounting for their actions (tracking logs).

The Threats: The main enemies are Malware (software viruses, ransomware) and Social Engineering (manipulating humans via Phishing).

2. The Best Practices (The How)
Lock the Door (Authentication): Use a Password Manager to create complex passwords and always enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This is your strongest defense.

Fix the Windows (Updates): Turn on automatic updates for your OS and apps to patch security holes immediately.

Trust No One (Vigilance): Be the Human Firewall. Inspect links before clicking (Hover Test), ignore urgent demands in emails, and never use Public Wi-Fi for banking without a VPN.

Backup: Follow the 3-2-1 Rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite) to ensure you can recover from a Ransomware attack.
